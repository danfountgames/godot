            Hello from the maintainer team!

            First of all, thank you for taking the time to report an issue here.

            In case you haven't already, be sure to attach an MRP (minimal 
            reproduction project) if **specific** steps or assets are needed in 
            order to reproduce the issue. Contributors will use the MRP to
            validate that the fix is working as intended.

            The time it will take to assess and fix your issue may vary.
            Follow the blog about our
            [new releases](https://godotengine.org/blog/release/) and
            [pre-releases](https://godotengine.org/blog/pre-release/) to track 
            new fixes or go to
            [our forum](https://forum.godotengine.org/) where users could help
            you in the meantime.

            Thank you for your patience.
